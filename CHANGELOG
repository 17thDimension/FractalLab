Fractal Lab Change Log
======================


5 March 2011:

4 March 2011:
* Added a manifest file for offline caching
* Extended the preset file to include the thumbnails


2 March 2011:
* Reworked local storage to add SQL storage for webkit which falls back to localStorage for Firefox


1 March 2011:
* Added background checker so that you can see which areas will be transparent
* Reworked the startup so that it doesn't compile immediately
* Embedding CSS images in the stylesheet now


28 Feb 2011:
* Fixed regression with the antialiasing (thanks @pauldoo)
* Removed background colour cast with transparent background and antialiasing.
* Added thumbnails when saving images (currently limited to 5Mb due to localStorage limit)


27 Feb 2011:
* Fixes for Chrome on Windows - removed pre-calculations from vertex shader, all now done in the fragment.
* Removed "Mandelbox Alt" formula as no longer used.


26 Feb 2011:
